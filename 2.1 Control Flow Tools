Besides the while statement just introduced, Python knows the usual control flow
statements known from other languages, with some twists.


a) If Statements

Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:

>>>
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...



b) For Statements

The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. 
Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), 
or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition 
(as C), Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string),
in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):

>>>
>>> # Measure some strings:
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
