Lists

Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.   

>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]



Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:

>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
1
>>> squares[-1]
25
>>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
[9, 16, 25]



All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means
that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:

>>> squares[:]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


Lists also support operations like concatenation:

>>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
