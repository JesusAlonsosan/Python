Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8

Standard library only uses ASCII


To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as
the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

# -*- coding: encoding -*-


For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your 
source code file should be:

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line.
In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:


#!/usr/bin/env python3  ("shebang")
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
