Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. 
For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series 
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) as follows:

>>>
>>> # Fibonacci series:
... # the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while a < 10:
...     print(a)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
